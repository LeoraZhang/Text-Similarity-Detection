### Text-Similarity-Detection
## Python(sklearn): CNN Model to Detect Text Similarity

Objective: 
In this case, my aim is to explore how to find which representitive of Democrat with most similar political backgrounds/experiences to a certain representative based on comparison of their profile texts. 
This can be used for parties/organizations to find candidates similar to an existed ideal candidate.
Further, I think this can be used to couple matching/date app. 
We can identify which two has the most similar requirements/experiences based on their profiles.
